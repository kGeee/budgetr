# Marketing site deployment + Polar

The public marketing site (landing, `/pricing`, `/getting-started`, `/thanks`)
is the **same Next.js app** built in "marketing-only" mode. Purchases run through
a **hosted Polar checkout** — the app itself has no license server and never
phones home (data stays on the user's Mac). Polar (a merchant of record, so it
handles VAT/sales tax) takes payment, issues + emails the license key, and
redirects the buyer to `/thanks`.

So there are two setup tracks, both mostly configuration:

1. **Polar** — create the product, get the checkout link, point its success URL
   at `/thanks`.
2. **Vercel** — deploy this repo in marketing mode with the right env vars.

---

## How marketing mode works

Setting **`MARKETING_ONLY=1`** flips the same build into the public site:

- `app/page.tsx` — `/` serves the marketing landing (instead of redirecting to
  `/overview`).
- `app/(app)/layout.tsx` and `app/(onboarding)/layout.tsx` — the private
  dashboard + onboarding routes `notFound()` (they touch the local SQLite DB,
  which doesn't exist on a serverless host).

> ⚠️ **`MARKETING_ONLY` must be set at RUNTIME, not just at build time.** If it's
> unset when a function runs, `/` redirects to `/overview`, which tries to open
> the local DB and 500s. On Vercel, add it as a normal **Environment Variable**
> (applies to build *and* runtime) — not only in `build.env`.

The purchase/download CTA is driven entirely by env (`lib/site.ts`): with a
checkout URL set the button is "Buy · $29"; with none it falls back to the free
GitHub download, so the page is never a dead end.

### Live demo (`DEMO_DB=1`)

Adding **`DEMO_DB=1`** turns on a live, read-only demo of the real dashboard so
visitors can try budgetr before downloading:

- The landing/`#screens` CTAs surface a **"Try the live demo"** button → `/overview`.
- `app/(app)/layout.tsx` relaxes its `notFound()` so the dashboard routes render
  (they still 404 on a marketing deploy *without* `DEMO_DB`).
- `db/index.ts` opens an **in-memory** SQLite DB (never disk), applies
  `db/demo-schema.ts`, and `lib/demo-data.ts` seeds the "Jordan Lee" dataset on
  the first request of each serverless cold start — so it works on Vercel's
  read-only filesystem and stays date-fresh.
- The dashboard is read-only: Sync, Connect, and Settings are hidden, and the
  demo banner's CTA becomes **"Download budgetr."** (Deep in-page edits still
  operate on the visitor's isolated in-memory copy and reset on the next cold
  start.)

> After any schema change (new migration), regenerate the demo schema:
> `bash scripts/gen-demo-schema.sh` (rewrites `db/demo-schema.ts`).

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `MARKETING_ONLY` | ✅ | Enables marketing mode (build + runtime). | `1` |
| `DEMO_DB` | optional | Serves a **live, read-only demo dashboard** on the marketing site (the "Try the live demo" CTA → `/overview`). Backed by an **in-memory** SQLite DB seeded per cold start (no persistent filesystem needed — safe on Vercel serverless), re-seeded with current dates each time. Unset ⇒ dashboard routes 404 as before. | `1` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHECKOUT_URL` | ✅ (to sell) | Polar hosted checkout link — the "Buy" CTA. Unset ⇒ free-download fallback. | `https://buy.polar.sh/polar_cl_xxxxxxxx` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | ✅ | Canonical origin for OpenGraph / `metadataBase`. | `https://budgetr.app` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRICE` | optional | Display price (default `$29`). | `$29` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOWNLOAD_URL` | optional | Free-download target (default: latest GitHub Release). | `https://github.com/kGeee/budgetr/releases/latest` |

`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are **inlined at build time** — after changing any of
them you must redeploy (a rebuild), not just restart.

## Part A — Polar

1. Create an **organization** at <https://polar.sh> (Polar is a merchant of
   record — it collects and remits VAT/sales tax for you).
2. **Products → New product** → **one-time payment** (fixed price). Set the price
   (match `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRICE`), name ("budgetr — lifetime license"), and a
   description.
3. Leave Polar's own **License Key** benefit off — budgetr mints its own. The
   checkout webhook (step below) signs an Ed25519 license key that the app
   verifies offline, so the key is enforced, not just proof of purchase.
4. Create a **Checkout Link** for the product (Product → Share / Checkout Links)
   → this URL is `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHECKOUT_URL`.
5. Set the checkout's **Success URL** to `https://budgetr.dev/thanks` so buyers
   land on our page (which mirrors the DMG download + setup steps). Polar appends
   `?checkout_id=…` to it; the page ignores it.
6. The DMG is delivered by public GitHub Release, so no file upload is needed —
   but you can also add a **File Download** benefit or a note linking the DMG in
   Polar's order confirmation email.
7. Go **live**: create a **production** organization/token (Polar has separate
   sandbox and production environments — sandbox checkout links only take test
   cards).

**The webhook is required** — it's what turns an order into a working license.
Point Polar at `/api/license/webhook` (`app/api/license/webhook/route.ts`). Polar
signs with the **Standard Webhooks** spec (HMAC over the raw body); the route
verifies it, then on a paid order mints a perpetual Ed25519 license keyed to the
order id (so retries re-mint the same key) and emails it via Resend.

It needs three env vars, **on the checkout deployment only**:

| Var | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | verifies the Standard Webhooks signature |
| `LICENSE_SIGNING_KEY` | the PEM private key that signs licenses |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | delivers the key to the buyer |

Never set these on a self-hosted install — anyone holding `LICENSE_SIGNING_KEY`
can mint their own licenses. With them unset the route no-ops with a 503, so it's
inert on user installs. The matching public key is compiled into the app
(`lib/license/public-key.ts`) and verification is fully offline: no phone-home,
14-day trial first, and `BUDGETR_LICENSE_DISABLED=1` opts self-hosters out.

## Part B — Vercel (git-connected — recommended)

Deploy straight from the GitHub repo so pushes to `main` auto-deploy; no local
CLI needed.

1. <https://vercel.com/new> → **Import** `kGeee/budgetr`.
2. **Root Directory → `web`** (that's where `package.json` / `next.config.ts`
   live). Framework auto-detects as **Next.js**.
3. **Environment Variables** (add to Production + Preview):
   | Name | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | `MARKETING_ONLY` | `1` |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | `https://budgetr.dev` |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRICE` | `$29` (optional) |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHECKOUT_URL` | _(add once the Polar checkout link is live)_ |
4. **Deploy.**
5. **Domain** → Project → Settings → **Domains** → add `budgetr.dev` (and
   `www.budgetr.dev` → redirect to apex). Vercel shows the DNS records to set at
   your registrar:
   - Apex `budgetr.dev` → `A 76.76.21.21` (or the ALIAS/ANAME Vercel gives), and
   - `www` → `CNAME cname.vercel-dns.com`.
   DNS + SSL propagate in a few minutes. Because `budgetr.dev` is no longer in
   `/etc/hosts` (see teardown below), it now resolves to Vercel everywhere.

### CLI alternative

Prereqs: `npm i -g vercel && vercel login`, then from the repo root
`vercel link` (Root Directory → `web`), `vercel env add …` for the vars above,
and `vercel --prod`.

## Local teardown — freeing `budgetr.dev` for public use

`budgetr.dev` used to be a local-only hostname (an `/etc/hosts` → `127.0.0.1`
entry served by Caddy). Now that it's the public marketing domain, remove the
local mapping so it resolves to Vercel; the local dashboard moves to
`budgetr.localhost` (or just `http://localhost:3000`).

```bash
# 1. Remove budgetr.dev from /etc/hosts (keeps budgetr.localhost):
sudo sed -i '' '/budgetr\.dev/d' /etc/hosts

# 2. desktop/Caddyfile now serves budgetr.localhost (already updated in-repo).
#    Caddy for local https is optional — localhost:3000 works without it.
```

## Gotchas

- **Private app routes on the marketing domain 500 instead of 404.** They're
  unlinked, but `db/index.ts` opens SQLite at import, so a direct hit (or
  crawler) to `/overview` errors. To make them 404 cleanly, add a middleware
  that short-circuits private paths when `MARKETING_ONLY` is set (before the
  route module — and its DB import — loads). Not blocking for launch; ask and
  we'll add it.
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` changes need a redeploy** — they're compiled into the client
  bundle, not read at runtime.
